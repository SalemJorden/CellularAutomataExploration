# Cellular Automata Exploration
I am building a simulator to observe the emergence of complexity in intelligent agents from simple rules. 
I am interested in complexity theory,dynamics,art, and evolutionary biology, and I am doing this project as a way to integrate all of these passions of mine at their respective intersections.

I will use a diverse tech stack to create a system that can be used to experiment with different types of cellular automata and intelligent agents. The simulator will be designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing users to explore the vast possibilities of cellular automata. I believe that this project has the potential to shed new light on the nature of complexity and intelligence, and to create new forms of art
