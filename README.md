I am building a simulator to observe emergence and complexity in cellular automata. I am interested in complexity theory, software dynamics, art, and artificial life (ALife).  
## Cellular automata: 
A cellular automaton is a discrete, dynamic model that is made up of a grid of cells. Each cell can be in a certain state, and the state of each cell can change over time, depending on the states of the cells around it. This means that it is a system that is made up of a finite number of discrete states, and that the state of the system changes over time in a discrete manner. The state of the system at any given time is determined by the states of the system at the previous time and by the rules that govern the system.
The rules that govern  cellular automata are typically very simple. However, the behavior of a cellular automata can be very complex, even with simple rules. This is because the behavior of the system is determined by the interactions between the cells, and these interactions can be very complex, even with simple rules. 
Cellular automata are often used to simulate the behavior of physical systems, such as the spread of disease, the emergence of life, or the behavior of the brain.
